  "e6e.powah.description2": "Besides this questline, your best friend when navigating the mod is the Powah Manual. Feel free to consult it every time you find yourself lost or are looking for more information on something.",
  "e6e.powah.description3": "Now then, let’s get started, shall we?",
  "e6e.powah.description4": "~Merlo",
  "e6e.powah.description5": "Everything in Powah is divided into different tiers, going from Starter to Basic, Hardened, Blazing, Niotic, Spirited and Nitro.",
  "e6e.powah.description6": "Different tiers of the same machine have different stats, all indicated on the machine’s tooltip.",
  "e6e.powah.description7": "For example a Starter tier Furnator will make 80 FE/t, taking 600 ticks (or 30 seconds) to burn through a piece of coal, where a Nitro tier Furnator will make 4800 FE/t, taking only half a second to produce the same amount of power.",
  "e6e.powah.description8": "Keep this in mind when progressing through the mod, always check the various tooltips in JEI and see what tier is right for your current situation.",
  "e6e.powah.description9": "Before we get into the various cool blocks and items Powah offers, let’s familiarize with some of the basic resources the mod will ask you to craft. Dielectric Paste is needed for most basic crafting components, so get used to seeing a lot. ",
  "e6e.powah.description10": "Automating it, keeping a Lava tank somewhere or a Blaze farm could be very useful! You can immediately see how it’s used to make some of Powah’s most basic components, like dielectric rods, that are themselves used to craft up a dielectric casing. ",
  "e6e.powah.description11": "This is what you will use to get started making most of the different machines we will see in the chapter, so let’s make a few!",
  "e6e.powah.description12": "Let’s generate some power! You’ll notice Powah has various generators that can make FE for you, the most basic being a Furnator. ",
  "e6e.powah.description13": "The name should be pretty self explanatory, it’s the equivalent of a furnace, but it will burn fuel to generate some power!",
  "e6e.powah.description14": "Make one and try it out, any tier will do. If you’re just starting out, you can try checking out the Starter or even the Basic tier.",
  "e6e.powah.description15": "With all this power generating everywhere we need a way to move it around and take it where we want it to be.",
  "e6e.powah.description16": "Powah cables are great at that! They can transfer a lot of power at the higher tiers and help keep setups neat, since you can walk through them even after setting them down, helping with maintenance.",
  "e6e.powah.description17": "Let’s try them out!",
  "e6e.powah.description18": "Another option you have to generate power is a Magmator, which also speaks for itself. Just give the bad boy some lava and watch it burn! One bucket of lava will generate a bit less than two coal pieces would in a Furnator.",
  "e6e.powah.description19": "Ever wondered if you could use lava as a renewable, self sufficient power source? Well the Thermo Generator is for you!",
  "e6e.powah.description20": "This handy device will generate a small amount of power as long as it’s placed over a heat source (lava, magma blocks, etc.) and has a liquid coolant (like water) in its internal tank.",
  "e6e.powah.description21": "Note: The FE/t values displayed in JEI are only the baseline. Liquid Coolants play an important role in energy production. ",
  "e6e.powah.description22": "This one comes as no surprise, every respectable power generating mod needs to have solar panels! They will passively generate FE as long as it’s daytime and they can see the sky.",
  "e6e.powah.description23": "Very handy for passive power generation!",
  "e6e.powah.description24": "The Lens of Ender is a nifty upgrade for any Powah Solar Panel. Just right click it on and it will be able to generate energy even without direct access to the sky!",
  "e6e.powah.description25": "You’ve seen all the basic means Powah has to generate FE, now it’s time to step it up and get into the big boys: let’s make a reactor! ",
  "e6e.powah.description26": "Not too fast though, you will first need some fuel, so let’s gather some Uraninite! Usually an ore, you can get it using Powah’s Energizing Orb with regular Uranium. Go get some!",
  "e6e.powah.description27": "Reactors are Powah’s best way of energy generation and will require a big multiblock and some more advanced maintenance.",
  "e6e.powah.description28": "Simply make 36 reactor blocks of any tier (all of the same tier) and place one on the ground to automatically build the 3x4 structure. ",
  "e6e.powah.description29": "Since the reactor is fairly complex and there would be not enough space to accurately describe how it works here, I will redirect you to its entry in Powah’s manual. You can learn all about how to make it work there.",
  "e6e.powah.description30": "Happy powering!",
  "e6e.powah.description31": "Note: The FE/t values displayed in JEI are only the baseline. These reactors are heavily influenced by the auxiliary materials added to them such as Carbon and Redstone. Liquid and Solid Coolants also play an important role in fuel efficiency. ",
  "e6e.powah.description32": "Isn’t your reactor so cool huh? Uh… it isn’t? Well you better hurry up and go cool it! Any kind of ice will do, but Dry Ice, a new material from Powah is the best of them. Go get some, quick!",
  "e6e.powah.description33": "Now that you’ve made some basic resources and power it’s time to ramp up and open the gate to all the next tiers of Powah items. Introducing the Energizing Orb and Rods!",
  "e6e.powah.description34": "To start crafting, place down the orb and then surround it placing some Rods close by connected to power.",
  "e6e.powah.description35": "The Rods will now start charging up the orb (faster depending on the rods’ tier and how many you have) and infuse power into the items you place in the orb.",
  "e6e.powah.description36": "This is how you craft all the basic resources you will use to climb up the tiers in Powah, so let’s start going for the top!",
  "e6e.powah.description37": "With all this power going around, you’re going to need somewhere to store it all. Introducing Energy Cells!",
  "e6e.powah.description38": "These handy blocks can store power for you and act as a big buffer, which will only get bigger the higher your cell’s tier is.",
  "e6e.powah.description39": "If you want to know detailed stats about each tier, please check the Powah Manual.",
  "e6e.powah.description40": "Ender Cells are Powah’s way to transfer power wirelessly and are one of the mod’s best features. Using them isn’t too intuitive at first, but gets easy once you understand them better.",
  "e6e.powah.description41": "First of all, you will have a number of channels available (more channels unlock with higher cell tiers), which by default store 0 FE.",
  "e6e.powah.description42": "These channels are universal for your player, so every ender cell you place in the world will have access to the same channels (provided they are of a tier that can access those channels).",
  "e6e.powah.description43": "Now, select a channel and Shift Right-Click an Energy Cell into the Ender Cell. It will get consumed, and it’s buffer will now become the channel’s buffer",
  "e6e.powah.description44": "(so for a new channel with 0 total max FE, inserting a basic cell will increase its buffer by 1M FE, since that’s the max buffer for the basic cell). ",
  "e6e.powah.description45": "You can keep stacking these cells and keep upgrading your channel. Once you store energy in that channel, you will be able to use it wherever you have an Ender Cell, making it easy to move power across very long distances.",
  "e6e.powah.description46": "You probably have a lot of items on you that are recharged with power. Isn’t it super tedious to remember to always keep them charged though?",
  "e6e.powah.description47": "Don’t you wish there was something that could tap into your energy supply and wirelessly charge anything into your inventory? Well you’re in luck!",
  "e6e.powah.description48": "Make a binding card and right click it to bind it to yourself, then craft a player transmitter and put the card in.",
  "e6e.powah.description49": "As long as the transmitter receives power, it will keep all your items charged!",
  "e6e.powah.description50": "Ender Gates are smaller, more convenient variants for Ender Cells. They can be placed on a Powah Energy Cable directly and they will occupy one blockspace.",
  "e6e.powah.description51": "This comes at a disadvantage however: you won’t be able to upgrade your channels from an Ender Gate, so you will always need to keep at least one Ender Cell somewhere.",
  "e6e.powah.description52": "The Dimensional Binding Card is a great update to a standard card. Right click a Binding Card on an Enderman and upgrade it: now it will be able to charge your inventory in any dimension and not just the one the Transmitter is in. Neat!",
  "e6e.powah.description53": "Energized steel is the basic material for all items in tier 3 (Hardened). Bring out your gold and iron and start alloying!",
  "e6e.powah.description54": "First of many Crystals, the Blazing Crystal is the basic material for all items in tier 4 (Blazed). Better start hitting up the Nether!",
  "e6e.powah.description55": "Next up is the Niotic Crystal, which is the basic material for all items in tier 4 (Niotic). I hope you have been mining for the blue shinies!",
  "e6e.powah.description56": "If you see the energizing orb take a really long time from now on when crafting crystals, it might be a good idea to add a rod or two.",
  "e6e.powah.description57": "We’re almost at the top! Spirited Crystals are basic material for all items in tier 5 (Spirited). Go make some friends among the Villagers!",
  "e6e.powah.description58": "No, you don’t need to get Discord Nitro and boost our server (even though you totally should).",
  "e6e.powah.description59": "It’s just a Nitro Crystal, the basic material for all items in tier 6 (Nitro)! You’re now at the top of the chain, so expect something really expensive and powerful. Bring out the big guns!",
  "e6e.powah.description60": "Here is the capacitor you will need for all the items in the hardened tier. Get ready to make a bunch!",
  "e6e.powah.description61": "Note that all capacitor quests from now on will be optional 'challenges'. You will need to make some to progress, so you might want to start automating!",
  "e6e.powah.description62": "Here is the capacitor you will need for all the items in the blazing tier. Can you make this many?",
  "e6e.powah.description63": "Here is the capacitor you will need for all the items in the niotic tier. It’s starting to get interesting huh?",
  "e6e.powah.description64": "Here is the capacitor you will need for all the items in the spirited tier. These challenges are starting to get a bit hard huh?",

  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description57": "● Touch > Grow > Harvest",
  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description58": "Place the Turret next to the crop, supply Source, and a periodic redstone signal for a nice fast farm.",

  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description61": "The growth of the crop may then provide Source to a Condenser to keep the Turret running.",
  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description62": "Considering the Turret needs a redstone signal to work, some form of clock is in order. There are many designs that will work, but perhaps something more thematic is in order?",

The type is determined by first brewing one the traditional way and, with potion in hand, right-click her cauldron to set the recipe. She’ll get to work as soon as everything is available. Just like traditional brewing, potions must be made in steps. One Wixie will make an Awkward Potion with Nether Wart, the next will add a Golden Carrot to make a Night Vision potion, and a third could add Redstone to extend it. ",
  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description83": "It is recommended to take that potion and stick it in the jar immediately so that the potion jar can be locked to that type.

  "e6e.ars_nouveau.description88": "A traditional casting focus, the Wand may be inscribed with a single spell. Contrary to other casting methods, however, no Form is required. All spells cast from a Casting Wand are automatically Projectile and come Accelerated. This means extra slots for adding Effects or Augments. This makes them ideal for specialized tools. ",

  "e6e.refined_storage.description0": "Refined Storage offers the ability to make vast electronic storage and automation networks, storing your items in Magic Computer Space and importing/exporting/autocrafting as desired. It's a rather refined method of storage, you might say.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description1": "Processors are basic components needed in most RS devices. You'll want to have a decent supply of slime before getting too deep into this.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description2": "The Controller is the heart of any RS network; exactly one is required for components to work. It accepts normal RF/FE power.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description3": "All parts of a network (excluding fancy wireless options later) must be connected via Cables. Interacting with the Controller itself will show a breakdown of how much power each component type is using.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description4": "To actually store items in an RS network, you'll want to make storage disks. These come in a variety of sizes; first try making one a 1k disk, the smallest size. You can retrieve the materials used to craft these (storage part/housing) by Sneak Right-Clicking with the item in hand.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description5": "The Disk Drive is your main method of holding storage disks. Up to eight can fit in a drive; you can swap them in and out as needed.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description6": "Fluid storage disks store fluid. Imagine that! Naturally, this involves somewhat different methods of accessing the contents of the disks; see the Fluid Grid quest for more information.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description7": "Importers automatically pull items from the connected inventory, and exporters automatically push (configured) items to the connected inventory. Both can be set to have filters or sped up with upgrades.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description8": "If you set up an External Storage part facing a normal inventory (e.g. a chest), that inventory will be treated as part of the network, and its contents can be accessed as though they were on storage drives.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description9": "The Grid is the primary means by which you can actually access the items in your storage. Simply connect a grid to the network and you can start chuckin' items in and out.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description10": "The Storage Monitor adds a handy (and stylish) way to see the current number of a given item (or amount of fluid) in your network at a glance. Sneak Right-Click it to open a config GUI.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description11": "You can even insert/extract the relevant item/fluid directly to/from this block.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description12": "The Fluid Grid works a bit differently from the normal Grid. Fluids can only be inserted/extracted via the use of fluid container items such as buckets.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description13": "The Crafting Grid, humanity's most glorious invention, is literally just a Grid with a built-in crafting table.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description14": "The 'crafting table' part of this block will retain its inventory when closed, and will automatically pull more items from the network into the grid to replace those that you use.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description15": "Wireless Grids are exactly what they sound like: handheld grid access in item form. These are exactly as great as they sound, and they come in all the normal types; for now, make a Wireless Crafting Grid.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description16": "These items must be charged, and they only work when near a Wireless Transmitter. These transmitters have a base range of 16 blocks.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description17": "16 blocks ain't enough! Each Range Upgrade will significantly increase a Wireless Transmitter's range, albeit at an increased power cost.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description18": "Patterns and Pattern Grids are both critical to the autocrafting process. In the Pattern Grid, you can encode a specific recipe on a Pattern item, which can then be placed in a Crafter for autocrafting.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description19": "There are two types of pattern recipes: 'crafting' and 'processing'. Crafting recipes are simply the basic 2x2 or 3x3 crafting recipes you can perform yourself.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description20": "Processing recipes can take a greater variety of inputs/outputs (e.g. stack sizes larger than 1) and represent operations that need machines or devices to perform.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description21": "Glorious autocrafting! Crafters are used to handle both types of pattern recipes. Each crafter can hold up to nine patterns.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description22": "For normal crafting recipes, that's all you need to set up - pop in a pattern and you gain the ability to request it from any connected Grid.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description23": "For processing recipes, the crafter must be placed facing the input of whichever machine is doing the processing. Note that all the crafter will actually do in this case is give the recipe items to the machine; getting the output into the network must be handled otherwise (e.g. with an Interface).",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description24": "Note: Placing identical processing patterns in multiple crafters will allow the system to intelligently share the job between multiple machines. This is particularly useful for crafts that involve multiple inputs, as otherwise distributing them would be complicated with most pipes.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description25": "When placed in a device, the Speed Upgrade will increase its speed (and power consumption). This is useful for Importers, Exporters, Crafters, etc.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description26": "The Stack Upgrade often serves as a more useful Speed Upgrade. It doesn't speed up individual operations, but instead allows each operation to move up to a stack of items.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description27": "The Crafting Monitor can be used to check the status of any in-progress crafting jobs, including current progress and predicted time remaining.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description28": "These blocks are quite important, particularly if you're setting up complex processing recipes and you need to be able to troubleshoot.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description29": "The Interface, like the Importer and Exporter, is a device that handles network input/output. Unlike the Importer and Exporter, it does not push or pull items to/from adjacent inventories.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description30": "The Interface is most useful as a simple (and perhaps less laggy) alternative to the Importer when the external item source can handle the 'pushing' itself, e.g. depositing items in the Interface with a conveyor belt.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description31": "Sure would be nice if you could connect your network to distant facilities without needing hundreds or thousands of cables. Here's a solution!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description32": "Place a Network Receiver at the distant location, then Sneak Right-Click it with a Network Card. Place a Network Transmitter in your main network and give it the Network Card, and presto - link complete.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description33": "Note that the Transmitter must be chunk loaded for this to work, and that you still must have only one Controller in the entire network (across all locations).",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description34": "Constructors can place or drop items from your system directly into the world, making in world automation much easier.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description35": "Can you guess what Destructors will do too?",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description36": "Do you keep running out of space in your Crafters? Don't you wish a better option existed, with more pattern slots so that you didn't need to keep crafting more? Well today is your lucky day!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description37": "Introducing the Iron Crafter! With three times as many slots as a normal Crafter, this machine will help you organize and keep your base tidy. Oh, and it might be upgraded further too...",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description38": "Absolute overkill? I don't know what that means! With a whopping 81 slots, the Netherite Crafter is the top tier option for all your autocrafting needs. It's never enough!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description39": "Tired of going around your base trying to find the right crafter to fit that pattern into? Introducing the Crafter Manager!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description40": "This handy block will connect to all the Crafters in your system and give you access to them all from the same block, for easy pattern management. You can even name your Crafters in an Anvil and the name will appear in the Manager!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description41": "Enjoy the mobility to build anywhere (almost) with a fancy new Infinity Range Booster!",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description42": "Only one card is required.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description43": "Perfect for that Summer home in the Ivis Fields.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description44": "This replaces the Infinity Booster, allowing limitless range even across dimensions.",
  "e6e.refined_storage.description45": "An Interface with a Crafting card is pretty good at keeping a small amount of several items in stock, but what if we need to go bigger? Well, now we can. The Requester is an addon block that allows Refined Storage to keep an internal stock of a given item at all times. Want 5000 glass ready and waiting for you? Set up a Requester to do just that. ",

  "e6e.pedestals.description19": "Entity Filters can be used to control what entities the Auto Attacker, Fan, and Potion Diffuser upgrades interact with. Filtering these upgrades is as easy as putting a specific block underneath the pedestal. The type of block determines the filter:",

  "e6e.pedestals.description21": "Emerald - Targets Players.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description22": "Diamond - Targets Monsters (Most Hostile Mobs, but not Slimes).",

  "e6e.pedestals.description28": "The Planting upgrade will plant seeds or saplings from its display. The Fertilizing upgrade will use Bonemeal from its display to fertilize plants.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description29": "The Harvester upgrade will break fully grown plants, dropping their seeds and crops on the ground. The upgraded pedestal can be given a Hoe, which it will use to harvest the crops (gaining the benefit of its enchants).",
  "e6e.pedestals.description30": "The Tree Chopper upgrade will randomly break logs within its operating area. If given an Axe the upgrade will use it, gaining the benefits of its enchants. If given shears, it will shear off and the leaves and drop them on the ground.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description31": "The Mushroom Chopper upgrade operates similarly. It will break Mushroom or Nether Mushroom blocks within range, and will use an Axe if one is supplied.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description32": "Pedestals with XP upgrades that are linked together form an XP Network. There are two main upgrades that allow you to add XP to a Pedestals XP Network - The XP Magnet and XP Grindstone.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description33": "The XP Magnet upgrade will collect XP orbs from its AOE and store them. It can also draw XP from a player that is on top of it. The Pedestal Speed enchantment will increase the speed at which it draws XP, while the Pedestal Capacity enchant will raise the number of levels it draws at once. The upgrade has a small buffer of 30 levels, so it is best to transfer the levels somewhere else (such as a pedestal with an XP Tank upgrade).",
  "e6e.pedestals.description34": "The XP Grindstone upgrade will draw up items from an inventory below the pedestal, grind off the enchantments, and display the newly disenchanted item. The upgrade will collect XP for the enchantments the items have and store it in its buffer.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description35": "XP can be removed from the network with two upgrades - the XP Dropper and XP Bottler. For both of these upgrades, XP can only be transferred into them - not out.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description36": "The XP Dropper will drop XP orbs from its top when XP is transferred to it. Because it immediately drops any XP it receives, redstone control is particularly useful with it.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description37": "The XP Bottler will pull empty bottles from the inventory below the pedestal, fill them with XP, and place Bottles of Experience in the display. These can then be thrown on the ground to produce XP orbs.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description38": "The Enchanter will allow you to enchant items, similar to a Vanilla enchanting table. It is worth noting that XP can only be transferred into this upgrade - not out. The upgrade will pull items from an inventory below the pedestal, enchant them using the levels in the upgrade, and display the resulting item.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description39": "This upgrade uses items with enchanting power, such as bookshelves, around it to determine the level it enchants at. Unlike a standard enchanting table, it can use bookshelves stacked 3 high, and they will not be blocked by torches or water. It can reach as high as level 96 with vanilla shelves surrounding it.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description40": "The XP Anvil can be used for repairing and combining items. It is worth noting that XP can only be transferred into this upgrade - not out.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description41": "Items placed in an inventory below the pedestal will be repaired using XP from the upgrade, similarly to the Mending upgrade. Once they are repaired, the upgrade will check up to 4 surrounding pedestals (one block from the anvil in each cardinal direction) for items to combine with it. It will then move the item to its display, combining with those items if possible. The following conditions apply to combining items:",
  "e6e.pedestals.description42": "● A renamed nametag in a surrounding pedestal will be consumed to rename the item.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description43": "● Books or even enchanted items can be placed on the surrounding pedestals, and their enchants will be transferred to the center item.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description44": "● When combining enchantments (Fortune 3 + Fortune 3 -> Fortune 4), if the resulting enchantment will be above the normal vanilla limit diamonds equaling the total of all enchant levels over the vanilla maximum are needed. These should be placed on one of the adjacent pedestals. Failing to supply enough diamonds will result in vanilla enchantment maximums.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description45": "Linked Pedestals with Fluid upgrades form a Fluid Network. The Fluid Importer and Exporter upgrades allow you to import and export fluids from inventories below their pedestals.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description46": "The Fluid Pump and Drain upgrades allow pedestals to manipulate fluid source blocks in world. Both will work on their working area. The pump will pull source blocks into its internal tank, while the drain will place source blocks from its internal tank. The drain can only receive fluids - it cannot send them.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description47": "The Fluid to XP upgrade imports liquid XP from a tank below the pedestal and convert it to XP for the XP network. This is very easy to automate, and makes integrating other mob farming tools with Pedestals simple.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description48": "Pedestals with Energy upgrades form an FE-based energy network. The Energy Importer and Exporter upgrades allow you to move energy into and out of the network from external sources.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description49": "This network can be used to move power around your base, but it can also be used to power certain upgrades.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description50": "The Crusher upgrades will perform various crushing operations on items in the inventory below the pedestal, and display the products. This will allow basic ore and dye doubling, allow the production of various dusts, and more - see JEI for a complete listing.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description51": "The upgrade will only process if its pedestal is empty; make sure to link it to a receiving pedestal to clear the products.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description52": "Pedestal Speed enchantments will decrease processing time, while Pedestal Capacity will make it process more items per action.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description53": "The Smelting upgrades will perform vanilla smelting recipes on items in the inventory below the pedestal, and display the products. This will also produce XP like a vanilla furnace, dropping the XP orbs on the ground.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description54": "The upgrades will only process if its pedestal is empty; make sure to link it to a receiving pedestal to clear the products.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description55": "Pedestal Speed enchantments will decrease processing time, while Pedestal Capacity will make it process more items per action.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description56": "The Sawmill upgrades will take wood products from the inventory below, cut them up, and display the products. This is generally used for Log to Plank processing, but there are other useful recipes that can be found in JEI.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description57": "The upgrades will only process if its pedestal is empty; make sure to link it to a receiving pedestal to clear the products.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description58": "Pedestal Speed enchantments will decrease processing time, while Pedestal Capacity will make it process more items per action.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description59": "The Quarry upgrade will mine blocks around the pedestal. They will use inserted filters to decide what to mine.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description60": "Pedestal Speed enchantments will decrease processing time. Pedestal Range and Area enchantments will increase the operating space of the quarry. The upgrade can also be enchanted with vanilla Fortune or Silk Touch, which will effect how blocks are broken.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description61": "The upgrade can also take a pickaxe, which will confer its enchantments (i.e. Fortune or Silk Touch) to the quarry.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description62": "These upgrades will harvest products from animals in a fixed area and display the harvested products.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description63": "The Shearer upgrade will shear sheep in its AOE, displaying the wool produced. It will only operate if the display is empty, so make sure to transfer the products out as they are produced.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description64": "The Hive Harvester upgrade will harvest combs and honey from nearby bee hives and display the products. To extract honey from a hive, the inventory below needs to have empty bottles the upgrade can fill.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description65": "The Milking upgrade will use empty buckets in an inventory below the pedestal to milk any cows in range, placing the filled bucket in its display.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description66": "Pedestals features various crafting and fluid crafting upgrades that will scan the inventory below the pedestal for recipes, and craft and display the resulting items if valid recipes are found. The upgrades come in 3 versions - 1x1, 2x2, and 3x3, which will scan inventory slots in groups of 1, 4, and 9 respectively. So for a vanilla chest, these upgrades will look for 27, 6, and 3 recipes respectively. The upgrade will not consume the last item in each slot of a recipe, allowing it to remember the recipe.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description67": "Crafting Placeholders are optional, but can be used to fill empty slots. The crafting upgrade will see these and ignore the slots, making it easier for you to read the recipe. The Fluid Crafter upgrades can also make use of Fluid Crafting Placeholders - these represent a bucket of fluid that the recipe requires, and they will use fluid stored in the upgrade (transferred from the fluid network) instead of a bucket.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description68": "The Compacting upgrades will look for at least 4 or 9 items in a single slot (2x2 and 3x3 respectively) that can be compacted, and display the resulting item. They will only operate if the display is empty, so you need to make sure to transfer products out of the display.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description69": "Pro Tips: You can use any inventory below the pedestal, even droppers and dispensers. Using these gives you a 3x3 inventory, making it easy to lay out a crafting table recipe. Additionally, these crafting upgrades function by continually scanning the inventory for applicable recipes, so the fewer inventory slots they needs to scan the faster they will operate.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description70": "Pedestals can transfer displayed items from one to another by linking them together. They can also transfer fluids, FE, and XP in their upgrades this way.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description71": "This is done with the Linking Tool: Sneak Right-Click a pedestal with the tool to choose the receiving Pedestal, and then do the same to choose the sending Pedestal. If this sounds backwards crouch-right-click the Linking Tool in the air to convert it into a Backwards Linking Tool, which links Sender -> Receiver.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description72": "Each Sending Pedestal can be linked to a maximum of 8 Receivers; Receivers can be linked to any number of senders.You can right click a Sender with the Linking wand to display information about it, and to get a visual indication of which pedestals it’s linked to. By default the sending mechanism uses a priority system, which is indicated by the color particles emitted - black is first, white is last.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description73": "Under normal conditions Sending pedestals will attempt to send whatever Items/Fluids/XP/FE they have to their linked receivers.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description74": "Powering a Recieving pedestal with a Redstone signal will prevent it from receiving Items/Fluids/XP/FE from a sender. This can be used to create custom routing systems. It will also disable its upgrade from functioning, and prevent it from being teleported to (Via the Teleport Upgrade). This behavior can be reversed by holding a redstone torch in your offhand and Sneak Right-Clicking the pedestal - this will insert the torch and make the pedestal active with a redstone signal.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description75": "Pedestals can also be read by a comparator, and will give off a signal relative to their fill level.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description76": "Pedestals has a series of upgrades to allow you to process materials with them. These upgrades have two versions:",
  "e6e.pedestals.description77": "The regular versions run on burnables dropped near them. When the pedestal has fuel on board, it will emit fire particles around its base.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description78": "The Energy versions run on FE supplied by the Pedestal network. Supply them with FE by linking them to Pedestals with FE stored in them.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description79": "Displaying items and moving them between pedestals is good, but you can add additional functionality with Upgrades. You'll need a number of these Upgrade Bases to get started.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description80": "Pedestal Upgrades can be added to a pedestal by holding them in your offhand and right-clicking the pedestal. They can be removed by holding another upgrade or the Upgrade Tool in your offhand while left-clicking the pedestal.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description81": "Right-Click a pedestal with the Upgrade Tool to get information about the upgrade on it.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description82": "The Tool Swapper will allow you to add or remove Tools to some upgrades. Hold a tool you'd like to add in your off-hand and Right-Click the pedestal with the swapper to insert a tool, or Right-Click the pedestal with the tool when your off-hand is empty to remove one.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description83": "Tool durability isn't used when a tool is inserted into a pedestal, but it does confer any enchantments on the tool (i.e. Fortune or Silk Touch) to the operation of the upgrade.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description84": "Pedestals provides two upgrades that will generate FE - the Energy Generator and Dis Enchantment Generator.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description85": "The Energy Generator will burn furnace fuels dropped on the ground and generate FE every 20 ticks. This energy is stored in the enchantment and is available for the Pedestals Energy Network.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description86": "The Dis Enchantment Generator will pick up enchanted items dropped near it (including enchanted books), grind the enchantments off of them, and produce energy from the enchantments. It will display the newly disenchanted item and store the resulting energy for the Pedestals Energy Network.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description87": "Augments can be added to a Pedestal to enhance a pedestal's item sending behavior. You can add up to 5 of each of the first 3 augments - the other 3 only require 1.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description88": "Speed - Decreases the delay between transfers.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description89": "Capacity - Increases how many items are transferred.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description90": "Range - Increases the distance allowed between linked pedestals.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description91": "Sound Muffler - Removes any sound an upgrade makes (except for tool equip sounds).",
  "e6e.pedestals.description92": "Particle Diffuser - Removes any particles produced by the upgrade.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description93": "Round Robin Augment - Changes the sending behavior of the pedestal from Priority to Round Robin.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description94": "It's wonderful that you can enchant your upgrades, but that can be so... random. These books allow you to ensure you get the particular enchant you need. Keep in mind that you cannot combine these with an upgrade in a vanilla anvil - you MUST use the XP Anvil from Pedestals.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description95": "Moving items around with Pedestals is as simple as linking them, but pedestals without upgrades are not part of the Pedestal network for Fluid, XP, or FE.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description96": "Relay upgrades allow you to add pedestals to their respective networks, while having significantly smaller buffers than tanks. They can also take filters to control what items are allowed to transfer through them, allowing you to prevent items from being sent places you don't want them.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description97": "Sometimes you want to store lots of stuff, and Pedestals has your back. These upgrades will enhance your ability to hoard large volumes of everything, and act as buffers in your Pedestals networks.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description98": "Capacity Enchantments greatly increase the capacity of these tanks, making them some of the highest density storage available.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description99": "Pedestal Upgrades can be enchanted; they can take vanilla enchants like Fortune and Silk Touch, but the mod also has six enchantments specific to it:",
  "e6e.pedestals.description100": "Capacity - In general this will increase the amount of stuff the upgrade can store. A typical progression of item storage would be 4/8/16/32/64 for levels 1-5.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description101": "Range - Typically Range enchantments will influence how far away from the pedestal the upgrade operates.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description102": "Speed - This will increase the operating speed of upgrades from 2-20x. The resulting speed will depend on the upgrade.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description103": "Area - Area enchants will generally increase the cube area that the upgrade works on.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description104": "Magnet - Will add Item Magnet functionality to Harvester, Block Breaker, Quarry, and Chopper upgrades.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description105": "Advanced - This allows the upgrade to interact with entities, and is detailed in its own quest.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description106": "Pedestals has upgrades for manipulating items and blocks in world - the Dropper, Placer, and Breaker upgrades.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description107": "The Dropper upgrade will drop items in the display from the top of the pedestal. Range enchantments modify how far from the top the items are dropped.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description108": "The Placer upgrade will place items from the display below the pedestal. Range enchantments will modify how far away the item is placed.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description109": "The Breaker upgrade will break blocks below the pedestal and display the result. Range enchantments will modify how far away from the pedestal the block that is broken is.",
  "e6e.pedestals.description110": "A pickaxe can be placed in the pedestal with the Tool Swapper - the upgrade will use this to break the blocks, conferring its Silk Touch or Fortune enchants on the upgrade.",

  "e6e.automation.description109": "Pretty Pipes' pipes follow a few fairly simple rules that are good to keep in mind when building with them. ",
  "e6e.automation.description110": "● First, a section of pipe may only insert or extract. Therefore, to send items from one chest to another requires a minimum of 2 pipes. ",
  "e6e.automation.description111": "● Second, an item will never be routed back to the inventory it was extracted from. So it's not possible to simply loop pipe around a furnace, for instance, to feed the output back into it. An intermediate storage inventory is required.",
  "e6e.automation.description112": "● Third, pipe sections can be disconnected from an inventory by Right Clicking them with the wrench.",
  "e6e.automation.description113": "● Fourth, upgrade modules may be installed in a section of pipe by right clicking the module on the pipe. Alternatively, right clicking with an empty hand allows one to access the pipe to add, remove, or configure modules. ",
  "e6e.automation.description114": "Finally, pipes may be covered with most any block, even transparent or partial blocks. Simply hold the desired 'cover' in your off hand and right click a section of pipe with the wrench to apply the block. ",
  "e6e.automation.description115": "Filter Modules are an excellent way to ensure that only certain items end up in a given inventory. Insert them into the pipe section adjacent to the inventory to be filtered on the receiving end. ",
  "e6e.automation.description116": "Filters can be upgraded with a number of useful Modifiers, such as NBT, Tag, and Mod filters. Insert these in the same section of pipe as the Filter Module.",
  "e6e.automation.description117": "Similarly, the Stack Limiter limits the number of items allowed in an inventory and works alongside the filter. A Stack Limiter set to 1, for instance, will only allow one of each item listed in the Filter module. ",
  "e6e.automation.description118": "Speed Modules combine with Extraction and Retrieval Modules. They don't effect how fast those Modules work, but rather how quickly the items travel once in the pipe network. ",
  "e6e.automation.description119": "Speed Modules are great in a small network, but in a larger network it can be costly to craft and insert them at every extraction point. ",
  "e6e.automation.description120": "The Pipe Pressurizer solves this by increasing the speed of every item passing through the connected network at the cost of a little energy. ",
  "e6e.automation.description121": "Retrieval and Extraction modules are required if anything is going to get anywhere.",
  "e6e.automation.description122": "Naturally, Extraction Modules pull from the adjacent inventories and send the items out into the network, assuming they have a place to go to. ",
  "e6e.automation.description123": "Retrieval Modules, in opposite fashion, pull from far inventories in an attempt to place items into the adjacent chests.",
  "e6e.automation.description124": "A simple network might consist of two chests connected by two lengths of pipe and either an Extraction Module or a Retrieval Module in one of the pipes. ",
  "e6e.automation.description125": "By default, pipes function in a 'nearest first' fashion. In order to override this and change the priority of a given inventory, place a Priority Module in the pipe adjacent to that inventory.",
  "e6e.automation.description126": "A High Priority Module in a chest that's farther away will cause items to attempt to go there first. ",
  "e6e.automation.description127": "A Low Priority module is excellent for creating a 'default' path, for instance to send to an overflow chest or a trash can. ",

  "e6e.automation.description129": "Looking to make a mini-game with your friends and want a simple randomizer? Then the Random Sorting Module will do exactly that.",
  "e6e.automation.description130": "For either of these to work, they ought to be placed in a section of pipe along with an Extraction module. Both will ignore priorities set on destination pipes. ",
  "e6e.automation.description131": "The Item Terminal acts as a central access point for the entire pipe network and shows the contents of every inventory on the network, excluding inventories connected via Extraction or Retrieval Modules. ",
  "e6e.automation.description132": "Items may be requested from the network by clicking the item, selecting a quantity, and pressing Request. ",
  "e6e.automation.description133": "Shift Clicking the + or - for the quantity will increase or decrease by 64 at a time, while Ctrl Clicking will increase or decrease by 10 at a time. ",

  "e6e.automation.description138": "Working with the Crafting Module will require a few pieces, however.",
  "e6e.automation.description139": "First, the machine in question must be connected to the pipe network on its Input side. For a Vanilla Furnace, this would be the top side. A Crafting Module is then inserted into this pipe section.",
  "e6e.automation.description140": "Next, a recipe needs to be set in the Module. Only one recipe may be set per module, but up to three modules may be inserted into a single pipe. Inputs go in the top half of the module, and the expected outputs go in the bottom.",
  "e6e.automation.description141": "With the recipe set, an Extraction Module needs to be installed on the output face of the machine. The Crafting Module does not export the crafted item.",
  "e6e.automation.description142": "Finally, ensure the required items are in the network and request the output item. Craftable items always appear with a 0 for their quantity and appear at the end of the list of items.",
  "e6e.automation.description143": "Of course, the Crafting Module does not need to go directly on the machine.",
  "e6e.automation.description144": "For instance, it could be installed on a pipe connected to a chest and a secondary network could then be connected to that chest which sends them to an array of furnaces.",

  "e6e.create.description5": "As with many systems, power is required. For Create, this generally means making something spin. There are, of course, multiple ways to do this, but let’s go over some basics briefly. ",

  "e6e.create.description11": "Perhaps the first multi part contraption to be made is the Windmill. This is a High SU generator capable of operating at high RPMs. Generating more SU and higher speed is merely a function of adding more Sails or Wool Blocks to the structure.",

  "e6e.create.description25": "The air stream can pass through certain blocks like Iron Bars and Trap Doors, allowing safe containment of your Lava and Water. ",
  "e6e.create.description26": "Of special note, the Fan can be used to process items directly on a Depot or Belt, however the items on a belt do not stop moving while they are being processed. ",
  "e6e.create.description27": "To make efficient use of a fan and belt setup, make it blow across the length of the belt. Faster spin speeds mean the air stream blows farther. This also allows the fan to process multiple stacks at once. ",
  "e6e.create.description28": "The ultimate in compact power generation. The Furnace engine is a three-part multi-block structure that provides the highest possible SU generation. ",
  "e6e.create.description29": "In order to run, the Furnace or Blast Furnace must be activated (lit). This would normally require it to be smelting something, though there are other ways to achieve this state.",
  "e6e.create.description30": "To build it, place the Furnace Engine on top of a Furnace or Blast Furnace. This will cover the furnace and a large section will project out from one side. On that side, leave an air block, then place the Flywheel (third block from the furnace). ",
  "e6e.create.description31": "Making a pretty windmill is probably not the only reason you’re here. Most likely, you’d like this thing to actually do something useful, but it’s way up there and we’re way down here… ",
  "e6e.create.description32": "As it happens, conveying rotational force is quite simple. Shafts can be used to convey power linearly while cogs may be used to change direction and speed. ",
  "e6e.create.description33": "Tired of unsightly holes in your base? Shivering from drafty shaft seals? Look no further. ",
  "e6e.create.description34": "Right click a Casing onto your shaft to convert it to a full block. Perfect for those times when the shaft is passing through walls or floors. ",
  "e6e.create.description35": "They also look great under Mechanical Belts.",
  "e6e.create.description36": "That’s a long run of shaft you’ve got there. Seems a little unsupported, no?",
  "e6e.create.description37": "Brackets are entirely decorative but can make your shaft network look much nicer.",
  "e6e.create.description38": "Slightly more costly than a pair of cogs, Gear Boxes serve the same purpose as perpendicular cogs, to change the direction of a shaft line. ",
  "e6e.create.description39": "However, they have a slight advantage in that they can be used to split power off in two directions. They also have a vertical variant to get a shaft line running up or down. ",
  "e6e.create.description40": "Just because our windmill is running a little slowly doesn’t mean everything else needs to. The rotational speed of a system can be stepped up (or down) by way of simple gear ratios. ",
  "e6e.create.description41": "For instance, assume your power is turning a small cogwheel. Connecting the teeth to a large cogwheel’s teeth will result in the shaft of the larger cogwheel rotating at half the speed of the drive shaft.",
  "e6e.create.description42": "Similarly, a large cogwheel that is interlocked with the teeth of a small cogwheel will cause that cogwheel’s shaft to rotate at twice the speed. ",
  "e6e.create.description43": "These effects may be chained but bear in mind that the faster the consumers in this system run, the higher the SU cost. ",
  "e6e.create.description44": "Additionally, two large cogwheels can be interlocked perpendicularly to allow a shaft to change directions. Useful for going around corners or bringing power down from high above.",
  "e6e.create.description45": "As with many things in Create, the Mechanical Belt is a multi-purpose item.",
  "e6e.create.description46": "Its primary purpose is item transportation and can carry items along horizontally, as well as up and down 45-degree slopes. ",
  "e6e.create.description47": "However, it can also convey power from one shaft to another. This can be an excellent way to power multiple parallel shafts while maintaining the direction of rotation. ",
  "e6e.create.description48": "A single belt can stretch up to 20 blocks and each block space could conceivably attach it to another shaft line if necessary. To attach them, simply place the two shafts and then right click each with the belt in hand.",
  "e6e.create.description49": "Encased Chain Drives may be used much like belts, connecting perpendicular shafts together.",
  "e6e.create.description50": "They may also be used to change the direction of power by placing multiple of them in-line and rotating them 90-degrees from one another. ",
  "e6e.create.description51": "It is not always practical to chain hundreds of cogs to achieve the exact right speed. Enter, the Rotation Speed Controller. Place a Large Cogwheel in the top slot and power it. ",
  "e6e.create.description52": "The Controller will automatically adjust to any RPM on its two output shafts. Set the speed with the scroll-wheel. ",
  "e6e.create.description53": "Funnels serve both to push into and pull from inventories. ",
  "e6e.create.description54": "A funnel attached to a chest, for instance, can extract from the chest and dump onto an adjacent Belt line. Similarly, a belt feeding into a funnel will push items into the attached inventory.",
  "e6e.create.description55": " The chute is a simple yet fast way to convey items downwards. Simply drop them in the top and they’ll come out the bottom. ",
  "e6e.create.description56": "The advantage that chutes offer over simply dropping an item in the world is that they can move items at a 45-degree angle and multiple chutes can converge into a single chute, allowing better control of where the item ends up.",
  "e6e.create.description57": "Chutes may also be used to convey items upwards. If a chute has an encased fan set up directly on top of it, it can be used to pull items off a Belt. Of course, getting that item out requires some way of extracting from the chute, such as a Funnel.",
  "e6e.create.description58": "Far from simple covers for your Mechanical Belts, Tunnels serve a useful purpose in splitting items. ",
  "e6e.create.description59": "As a stack of items passes through an Andesite Tunnel, it will automatically take 1 item from the stack and place it onto adjacent belts or depots. ",
  "e6e.create.description60": "Brass Funnels function similarly to Andesite Funnels, although they can accept a filter, either in the form of a single item clicked into the filter slot, or a configured filter item.",
  "e6e.create.description61": "Brass Tunnels work a bit differently than Andesite Tunnels. Rather than splitting onto adjacent belts, a line of Tunnels can be formed along multiple parallel belts. ",
  "e6e.create.description62": "As items pass into one tunnel, they’ll be evenly split among all connected tunnels on the other side. ",
  "e6e.create.description63": "Filters are respected during these split operations, so a sorting system can be made that takes a lot of mixed inputs and sorts them out onto individual belts. ",
  "e6e.create.description64": "A simple item buffer. ",
  "e6e.create.description65": "Depots will hold a single stack of items, but they will also interact with Encased Fan Washing, Blasting, and Smoking recipes, as well as the Plate Press. ",
  "e6e.create.description66": "Mechanical Arms serve as advanced short range item transport. They may be linked to multiple points at once for both extraction and insertion.",
  "e6e.create.description67": "For instance, an Arm could be configured to pull sand from funnel and place it on a depot where an overhead Encased Fan smelts it to glass. That same Arm can then take the glass and insert it into another filtered Funnel to send it on its way.  ",
  "e6e.create.description68": "Linking occurs prior to placing the Arm, simply right click it onto permitted inventory types to set it. Right click again to toggle between input and output. The arm reaches four blocks in total. ",
  "e6e.create.description69": "Millstones have been used for ages, representing some of our oldest technology still in use. They’re far more efficient than grinding things by hand.",
  "e6e.create.description70": "Create’s Millstone is an excellent early way to stretch your ores a little further. Be sure to wash the resulting Crushed Ore pieces to further enhance the yield! ",
  "e6e.create.description71": "Crushing Wheels are the big brother to the Millstone you have used until now. In general, they do a better job, allowing you to get more for your inputs than you would in the Millstone. ",
  "e6e.create.description72": "Their harder milling surface is also capable of dealing with materials that the Millstone cannot. ",
  "e6e.create.description73": "Setting up a pair of Crushing Wheels will require a little bit of clever thinking as both wheels must be rotated in opposite directions with the tops rotating towards the point where the two wheels meet. ",
  "e6e.create.description74": "Place the wheels with a single block gap between them. Items may be either dropped in the top or inserted in a more controlled manner by funneling them into the ‘block’ space where the two wheels meet. ",
  "e6e.create.description75": "A Deployer while useful for many things, is the primary means of automating Polished Rose quartz. ",
  "e6e.create.description76": "The held item may be inserted into the Deployer by Belt and Funnel, Hopper, or most any other item transport method. When powered, it will continuously attempt to ‘use’ the held item on any entity in front of it, be it item or mob. ",
  "e6e.create.description77": "To polish quartz, it is simply a matter of dropping the quartz in the path of the moving deployer hand.",
  "e6e.create.description78": "Electron Tubes are used to craft the most advanced machinery in Create and they pose a bit of an automation challenge in the form of Polished Rose Quartz.",
  "e6e.create.description79": "Rose Quartz is polished with Sandpaper. At the start, this will be done by manually by holding a piece of sandpaper in one hand and Rose Quartz in another. Hold right click to grind it to a shiny finish.",
  "e6e.create.description80": "But what’s this you say? Can this not be automated with all these fancy gears and whistles? Of course! But the machines to do so need Electron tubes themselves!",
  "e6e.create.description81": "With some basic power and logistics under our belts, it’s time we get our hands dirty and get down to business. Create offers several new crafting mechanics that are important to understand to work with the mod. ",
  "e6e.create.description82": "The Mechanical Press is a great way to transform your ingots into plates for more advanced crafting. It will also compact your materials when combined with a basin, making ingots from nuggets.  ",
  "e6e.create.description83": "For Plates, the Press can be installed over a Belt, Depot, or any other block. ",
  "e6e.create.description84": "If placed over a Belt, it will automatically cause the Belt to pause while the Press is operating. ",
  "e6e.create.description85": "When over a Depot, it will similarly work as soon as it detects an item below that needs pressing.",
  "e6e.create.description86": "While over any other block, however, a redstone signal is required to make it start. ",
  "e6e.create.description87": "The Mechanical Mixer helps blend both solids and liquids into more useful forms, from brewing potions, making tea, or making advanced alloys, the mixer does it all. A basin below the mixer is required.",
  "e6e.create.description88": "Note that some recipes require heat, this is provided by way of a Blaze Burner. More on that next.",
  "e6e.create.description89": "When high temperatures are required, there’s nothing quite like the scorching heat of the Nether. Why not bring it home with you too?",
  "e6e.create.description90": "Blaze Burners are created by right clicking an empty burner on either a Blaze (consumes the mob) or a Blaze Spawner (does not consume the spawner). They’ll burn hot, but not forever. ",
  "e6e.create.description91": "Feed them coal or other burnable material to get them riled up again if they cool down.",
  "e6e.create.description92": "What do you mean that’s not hot enough? Well, let them eat cake!",
  "e6e.create.description93": "Making Blaze Cake will really test your skills as it combines a lot of different mechanics. How far can you take your automation?",
  "e6e.create.description94": "Just as moving items isn’t free, so to does it require some rotational force to pump and work with fluids.",
  "e6e.create.description95": "The Mechanical Pump accepts power from a cog, pressurizing a section of pipe to cause fluid to flow in one direction or the other, depending on the direction of rotation. ",
  "e6e.create.description96": "The block has a handy little directional indicator to help visualize the flow. A single pump can pressurize a large section of pipe, so be sure to spread them out. ",
  "e6e.create.description97": "Pipes are the primary means of conveying fluids. Fluid goes in, fluid goes out. Simple!",
  "e6e.create.description98": "Fluid valves may be opened and closed by applying some rotational force, for example with a Valve Handle. ",
  "e6e.create.description99": "Doing the impossible is just another Tuesday in modded. Smart Fluid Pipes act as a fluid filter, either controlling what is allowed to be pulled from a connected tank, or what is allowed to continue down the line. ",
  "e6e.create.description100": "Fluid Tanks are a thematic multi-block tank for all your fluid storing needs. ",
  "e6e.create.description101": "While they can't be interacted with by the player directly, needing pipes to insert and extract fluids, they merge with adjacent tanks to form large multi-blocks for bulk storage.",
  "e6e.create.description102": "They can have a 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3 base and extend as high as you like. ",
  "e6e.create.description103": "For those times when a simple 3x3 grid simply isn’t good enough, there’s the Mechanical Crafter. Or, Crafters, to be precise. These interlocking blocks connect to form a large crafting interface. Each block accepting a single item for the craft.",
  "e6e.create.description104": "Several advanced items may only be crafted this way.",
  "e6e.create.description105": "Take note when placing the crafters themselves as there will be an arrow pointing towards the block that was clicked to place it. This arrow indicates which way items will travel as the crafters work and all arrows must connect to a single crafter.",
  "e6e.create.description106": "For example, placing the first crafter on the ground will make the arrow point down, this would be the output. A crafter to the side of the first would need to be placed against the side so that its arrow points into the first, making a channel. ",
  "e6e.create.description107": "Crafter Slot Covers can be used to disable a given slot, which is required for any craft that has empty spaces in it. For instance, when crafting a chest with a 3x3 grid of Mechanical Crafters, the middle slot must be covered. ",
  "e6e.create.description108": "Items may be inserted with hoppers, belts and funnels, mechanical arms and more. Experiment to see what you can come up with!",

  "e6e.create.description115": "They can either be fixed in place and run using rotational power, or they can be attached to a minecart and run for free, requiring only powered rails to keep the cart moving. ",

  "e6e.create.description117": "When it comes to moving contraptions, Mechanical Pistons can be a great early start. ",
  "e6e.create.description118": "As a simple example of where one might use these, imagine a long field of crops. A Mechanical Piston could be used to push a harvesting contraption back and forth over the field periodically to gather crops. ",
  "e6e.create.description119": "Cart Assemblers are used to build a contraption destined to ride a mine cart. ",
  "e6e.create.description120": "The contraption should be built on top of the Assembler. Once prepared, giving the assembler a Redstone signal will convert all connected blocks into one entity. ",
  "e6e.create.description121": "The entire cart can then be picked up by using a wrench on it, allowing for easy transport of the device. ",
  "e6e.create.description122": "A great example of a mine cart-based contraption would be a tunnel bore mining machine. It could be set up to lay down its own track in front of it and pull up track behind it. It could even build its own bridges to avoid ravines!",
  "e6e.create.description123": "Similar to Windmill Bearings, Mechanical Bearings may be used to build rotating contraptions. ",
  "e6e.create.description124": "For instance, a long sweeping armed contraption could be built that swings through a tree farm, cutting down all the trees it encounters. ",
  "e6e.create.description125": "Chassis blocks serve to form a base for larger creations. ",
  "e6e.create.description126": "Linear chassis connect to one another along the darker edge and will automatically be treated as a ‘whole’ piece that other parts may be glued to. ",
  "e6e.create.description127": "They will also capture a line of blocks attached to the lighter side if glue is placed on the chassis itself. ",
  "e6e.create.description128": "Similarly, Radial chassis can capture blocks in a circular plane so long as they all touch and the one in contact with the light face of the chassis has been glued in place.",
  "e6e.create.description129": "This results in the ability to build very large contraptions with very little glue. However, they are not required. Instead, blocks may simply be glued together to form a larger piece in an irregular shape.",
  "e6e.create.description130": "Worry not, once the contraption is formed, the glue marks will become invisible, allowing for very aesthetic builds.",
  "e6e.create.description131": "Use your scroll wheel while holding a wrench and looking at the chassis to configure its capture range. ",
  "e6e.create.description132": "Note: A slime ball may be used infinitely to set glue marks on Chassis blocks themselves. Right-Click with the slime ball to apply to one side. Double Right-Click to apply to all sides.",

  "e6e.create.description138": "When stationary and powered, it can serve both for cutting logs to planks and for any stonecutter recipe. Stonecutter recipes will give a random output unless a filter is set on the Saw itself.",

  "e6e.create.description140": "In many cases, the tools that can be attached to a moving contraption will also automatically pick up the items they’re harvesting, so long as there is ample storage on the device. ",
  "e6e.create.description141": "Simply gluing a chest in place is sufficient for providing that storage place, but getting items out again is another matter. ",
  "e6e.create.description142": "Interfaces act as a proxy for the inventories on moving machines. Whenever a Portable Interface on a contraption meets an Interface sitting in the world, the contraption will pause briefly, creating a connection.",
  "e6e.create.description143": "If something is set up to pull from, or push to that interface, the machine will remain paused until nothing is flowing through the Interface. Once the flow has stopped, it will move on.",

  "e6e.rftools_wip.description1": "The quests will guide you to some of the mods key items, but will leave some items up to you to find and discover.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description2": "We will also touch on XNet, a companion to RFTools designed especially for item transportation! Well, what are we waiting for, let’s get started!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description3": "~Merlo",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description4": "Get familiar with this guy, it will be the basic block you will have to craft for every RFTools machine, just like his sister, the Machine Base, for the smaller devices. Better stock up on them!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description5": "Get familiar with this girl, it will be the basic block you will have to craft for every RFTools device, just like her brother, the Machine Frame, for the bigger machines. Better go make a bunch!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description6": "Have you ever wanted to transfer redstone signals easily and without all of those ugly wires? Well just make a redstone transmitter and a receiver!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description7": "They work with channels, meaning any receiver on a channel X will output the same redstone signal its getting from transmitters on the same frequency. If you simply place down one of these blocks they will automatically connect to a new channel.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description8": "To then connect other blocks to the same channel frequency just take them and right click them on another transmitter or receiver that is already on that channel. Pretty sweet huh?",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description9": "The inventory checker is a very unique device that can, as its name suggests, check for specific items in specific slots of any inventory it’s looking at. It can even work with tags! ",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description10": "Its use cases might be a bit niche, but it will prove to be very useful in complex automation setups.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description11": "This one is pretty easy, just a regular old redstone timer you can place down and manually program delays for. You can also reset it by giving it a redstone signal on its input (the one with the blue inwards V).",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description12": "The logic is a simple yet effective way to create custom logic gates for all your redstone needs.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description13": "It takes three inputs, from the three different sides of the machine with blue arrows, and outputs a signal from the orange arrow’s side based on the configuration programmed inside of it.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description14": "You can check for any different combination of inputs (for example, two specific sides off and one on) and manually set the desired output.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description15": "You can view the analog as a more advanced logic of sorts. It still has three inputs, however it compares two of them (named A and B in the machine), and outputs a signal of strength based on the third input, with some custom calculations applied.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description16": "You can also have different factors for the input calculations depending on the comparison of the A and B signals.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description17": "The sequencer is yet another small device you can use to create custom redstone circuits.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description18": "This one is a bit more advanced and can look confusing at first, but is actually pretty straight forward: think of the grid you see in the GUI as a time sequence, starting from the upper left corner and ending in the lower right. ",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description19": "Every square represents a game tick, so 1/20th of a second. For example, if you were to light up the first 20 squares, the sequence would now be an on signal for a second, and then off for the rest of the duration.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description20": "You can also customize how the sequence will trigger (by default it will only activate once, the first time the block receives an input signal. Check all the modes and cycle through them by clicking on the “Once1” button).",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description21": "Just like its name implies, the sensor can be used to check for the presence of a number of blocks, items, entities and other things in different areas in front of it, giving out a redstone signal when the conditions are met. Pretty handy device!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description22": "RFTools offers a quick and easy way to teleport around the world, which can come in really handy to travel around the world or simply to always have a quick way to get back home.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description23": "The two main blocks you’ll need are receivers and transmitters: the first ones are where you can teleport to, and the second ones are where you can teleport from.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description24": " First of all, set down some receivers in the places where you want to teleport and make sure they are powered. Then, place down a Transmitter and a Dialing Device somewhere in your base.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description25": "The Dialing Device will be able to see all the public Receivers in the world and the private ones for which you are whitelisted (you can also name Receivers to identify them more easily).",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description26": "Choose which Receiver you want to be dialed to in the Dialing Device and you will see the Transmitter light up: step on it and woosh! Teleportation!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description27": "Teleportation is cool and all, but what if you could teleport to your Receivers without having to place down a Transmitter every time? Introducing the Charged Porter! Sneak Right-Click on any Receiver you can access to save it into the Porter.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description28": "Providing the Porter has power, you can then simply right click it and teleport there immediately!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description29": "While the regular Porter can only store one Receiver, the Advanced one can have up to 8, and you can switch between them by Sneak Right-Clicking it into the air. Try it out!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description30": "Dimensional shards are the only raw resource introduced by RFTools, found in rare ores but also craftable with rare materials. You will need a bunch of these for crafting and to infuse all of your RFTools machines. Go gather a bunch!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description31": "You might have noticed some RFTools machines have an “Infusing Bonus” written in orange in their tooltips.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description32": "Take any of those machines, place them into the machine infuser with four stacks of dimensional shards and some power, and you’ll have successfully infused that machine, unlocking said bonus and powering up your machine!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description33": "Crafters are really nice machines, which should be pretty self explanatory: they craft stuff for you.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description34": "The nice thing about them is that they’re able to chain recipes as well, so if you teach them how to make planks from wood and sticks from planks they’ll be able to make sticks from wood no problem.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description35": "They come in different tiers, and the only real difference between them is the number of recipes they’re able to remember, with 8 being the max amount on the highest tier.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description36": "Unsurprisingly, the Builder is a machine that can build stuff for you. However, it might surprise you to see it can do much more! The Builder works with a Shape Card, of which there are many varieties.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description37": "Sneak Right-Click your shape card on the Builder, and then go Sneak Right-Click it on the first and second corner of the area you want to work with.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description38": "Now you can also right click the Shape Card into the air to configure it further, changing the shape, the size, the dimensions and so on.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description39": "Once you’re done, place the Shape Card into the Builder to start working! Depending on which card you have, the Builder will build in the selected area, quarry out the selected area, pump fluids and more.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description40": "In all these cases, you’ll need power and an inventory above or below the Builder to grab/put blocks into.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description41": "Quick tip, clicking the lifebuoy icon in the builder will activate preview mode, and you’ll be able to see an outline of the area you’re working with.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description42": "This is the Quarry Shape Card for the Builder. Unsurprisingly, this one will dig blocks from the selected area and will place them into the Builder’s inventory.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description43": "There are many different variations of the Quarry card, like Fortune or Silk Touch.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description44": "The Clearing cards will also actually dig the block and leave a hole in the world, while the normal Quarry cards will replace what they dig with Dirt. You can also Configure the Card to void certain blocks, like stones or dirt.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description45": "This is the default Shape Card for the Builder. If you use this one, the Builder will place blocks from its inventory in the selected area.",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description46": "The various pump cards will pump up liquids from the selected area, so you’ll need some sort of tank above or below the builder. There’s also one for placing fluids!",
  "e6e.rftools_wip.description47": "The Modular Storage is an advanced form of item storage. Place one down and then make an items storage module, like the tier 1 one provided by this quest.",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description4": "Despite the name of the mod, simply going out and slaughtering wantonly is exactly the wrong way to go about gathering LP. This is a process that requires finesse... precision. Your vict... Donor might need to be held down.",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description9": "More fundamentally, the Altar will serve as a receptacle for transmuting objects with stored LP. To begin filling it, use a Sacrificial Knife near it to drain some of your own blood into the Altar. Another option is using the Dagger of Sacrifice to sacrifice mobs instead of your own health. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description10": "Once it is full, right click an item into the Altar to begin the transmutation process. Red particles mean the craft is proceeding normally, whereas grey particles mean there's not enough LP and the craft is losing progress. ",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description13": "The ashes are used to draw a sigil on the ground, and then a binder and reagent are combined within it to create powerful tokens that may be powered via the Soul Network. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description14": "The Sentient Sword, infused with Demonic Will, is as much 'alive' as the one who wields it. It hungers for more power and seeks out its own, drawing Demonic Will from slain enemies without the need for a Soul Snare. ",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description16": "Demonic Will is not some dumb substance to be manipulated like water in a bucket. It is the animating force that enables the undead to move, the extension of some demonic force long locked away. The barriers between worlds are not perfect, however, and some of their immense power leaks through.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description17": "Tartaric Gems are a relatively safe way to coalesce this will, binding it in a way that allows the Sanguimancer to control it without being controlled in return. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description18": "Any Demonic Will harvested while a Tartaric Gem is in one's inventory will automatically be gathered into the gem. Making two or more such gems will be beneficial in the long run. ",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description24": "Thankfully, the Blood Altar allows items to be piped in, either via Hopper or most any other item transport method. When piped in, up to a full stack may be transmuted at once. Of course, the LP cost remains the same per item, but the overall time to transmute does drop since there is no pause between each item.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description25": "Early on, it may not be wise to insert a full stack, however. Pretty Pipes has a few features that will assist here. Use the provided items to set up some simple automation. ",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description27": "● The Stack Limiters will prevent too many items going into the altar at once, and may also be used to permit only a certain number of slates in the output chest.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description28": "● Finally, the Filter Module will be useful for defining what's allowed to go into the output chest. Between this and the stack limiter, a stock keeping system can be set up to always keep 64 of each slate in the output chest.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description29": "A note on Pretty Pipes: A pipe with an Extraction Module cannot input into another inventory. Two lengths of pipe are required, one to extract, and another to insert.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description30": "The Blood Orb is a Sanguimancer's primary link to their Soul Network. Keeping an orb in one's inventory will allow it to power any personal Sigils. Similarly, keeping one in a Blood Altar will allow it to drain the LP from the Altar and transfer it into the Soul Network. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description31": "Hold the Orb and right click it once to bind it. Anyone using this Orb will draw from your personal Soul Network.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description32": "With a few slates to craft into Blank Runes, the Altar can be augmented, increasing its capacity, transmutational abilities, and even allowing for specializations. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description33": "To upgrade to a Tier 2 Altar, 8 Runes of any type are required. The Sanguine Scientiem shows the exact structure required. Use the provided Speed runes to fill out the structure and give it a little kick. ",

  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description44": "With the basic Ritual Diviner, only a few rituals will be available, but a few notable ones are the Serenade of the Nether, which generates Lava, and the Ritual of the Green Grove which causes crops in the area to grow at an accelerated rate. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description45": "To build a Ritual, place down the Master Ritual Stone. Next, Sneak + Right Click the Ritual Diviner in the air to choose the desired ritual. Finally, with sufficient Ritual Stones in your inventory, right click the Master Ritual Stone with the Diviner to automatically place the blocks.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description46": "Now that the ritual is built, an Activation Crystal is required to actually make it start. Right click the Master Ritual Stone with the Activation Crystal. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description47": "Once activated they will drain LP continuously, which may not always be desired. They may be turned on and off with redstone, however. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description48": "In order to build the fourth and final tier of Blood Altar, a bit of dabbling in Alchemy will be required. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description49": "As with previous tiers, check the Sanguine Scientiem for a guide on how to build the upgraded altar, and be sure to upgrade your Blood Orb.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description50": "The Alchemical Reaction Chamber goes hand in hand with the Alchemical Workbench and Blood Altar. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description51": "By using different reagents, it can enable stronger reactions that would have been unsafe to perform in the open air. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description52": "Though keeping Demonic Will locked up is advised, an experienced Sanguimancer may choose to release some into the environment in order to refine it further. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description53": "Placing a Tartaric Gem into a Demon Crucible will release the Will, binding it to the local chunk. The amount of will present may be seen with the aid of a Demon Will Aura Gauge. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description54": "Excess Will may be absorb into a Tartaric Gem again by placing a Hellfire Forge in the chunk and inserting the Tartaric Gem.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description55": "Once released into the atmosphere, Demonic will may be coaxed to a nucleation site where it will begin to crystallize and grow. A Demon Crystallizer acts as one such site. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description56": "Demon Will Crystals will progress through multiple stages of growth, each denoted by a new spire forming out of the base. The first spire should never be broken off, this initial growth is costly, but greatly reduces the Will required to grow additional spires. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description57": "Some care must be taken when harvesting crystals; a pickaxe is exactly the wrong tool for the job. Instead, hold a Tartaric Gem in your inventory and Right Click the grown Will Crystals with an empty hand. Each click will gently snap off one of the spires. This method will never break the central spire.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description58": "There exists a specialized Dusk ritual that would assist in automating this process as well, which causes the secondary spires to fall off naturally. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description59": "The Dusk Ritual Diviner allows a Sanguimancer to construct larger, more elaborate Rituals. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description60": "A few notable examples:",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description61": "Ritual of the Feathered Knife - Automatically generates LP using the health of a nearby Player.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description62": "Crack of the Fractured Crystal - Gently harvests Demon Will Crystals in the area, dropping them on the ground nearby.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description63": "Resonance of the Faceted Crystal - Facilitates the growth of specialized Demon Will Crystals.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description64": "With Demonic Will Crystals in hand, the careful process of separating out their base essences may begin. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description65": "Prepare another Demon Crystallizer and construct the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal ritual. Place the Crystallizer atop the Master Ritual Stone and begin pouring Will into the chunk by way of a Crucible.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description66": "Eventually, another crystal will form here within the bounds of the ritual. Once it has fully grown, the ritual will fragment it into its elemental essences, growing four new crystal types around it which may be harvested in the same way as the previous Demonic Will Crystals. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description67": "Raw Demonic Will is of a more general purpose, but with the new will crystals that have been created, new abilities may be granted to our Sentient Tools.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description68": "First, a Tartaric Gem must be prepared, either freshly created or by draining all of the Will from it in a Crucible. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description69": "Next, burn a few of a single type of Will in a Crucible in a chunk without any Will present. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description70": "Finally, place a Hellfire Forge in this chunk and use it to re-absorb the Will into the Tartaric Gem. Its color will change to match the color of the Will that was absorbed.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description71": "With this specialized Tartaric Gem in your inventory, right clicking with any Sentient Tool will shift its attunement to that of the Tartaric Gem, thus granting that tools the abilities of the Will Type. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description72": "Beyond this, however, these new Demonic Wills open up entirely new avenues by way of Augmenting Rituals. Refer to the Ritual Diviner for more information on how each Will type effects each ritual. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description73": "Setting the type of Will associated to a Ritual is performed with a Ritual Tinkerer. Sneak + Right Click the air to cycle its mode to Set Will Consumed. Place the desired Will Crystals on your hotbar (more than one is allowed) and Right Click the Master Ritual Stone of an active Ritual to set those types. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description74": "Feeding the Ritual the appropriate Will types is as simple as burning those crystals in a Hellfire Forge in the same Chunk. Of course, arranging for that to happen automatically is a whole other challenge. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description75": "With the tools available at a proper Alchemy Table, the Soul Network may be used to drive more complicated transmutations, from transmuting rotten flesh to proper leather, to processing ore down into higher yields than is possible in a traditional furnace. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description76": "A Blood Orb must be placed in the right most slot, and the reagents for the craft are spread around the six outer slots on the left hand side. The result will then appear in the middle. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description77": "When seeking to automate this work bench, consider using some limiting pipe similar to the earlier Blank Slates. Inputs can be piped in the sides, while the output may be extracted from the bottom. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description78": "The Incense Altar serves to help calm and center a Sanguimancer prior to using the Sacrificial Knife for self-sacrifice. Standing near the altar will cause the knife to glow. It may then be used to draw a larger portion of health instantly, filling the Blood Alter with an equivalent amount of LP. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description79": "Refer to the Sanguine Scientiem for more information on expanding the Incense Altar, increasing its effect. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description80": "With Routing Nodes, complex item transport can begin. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description81": "Routing Networks have four main components, the Master, Input, Output, and plain Routing Nodes. Each node may be wirelessly linked to other nodes within 16 blocks. One connection must reach back to the Master Routing Node, but networks may spread from there through any other nodes. Sneak Right Click a node with a Node Router to select it or bind a selected node to it. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description82": "Only one Master Routing Node is required per network but be sure one is present, or nothing will work!",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description83": "Input Routing nodes pull from adjacent inventories, while Output Routing nodes push into adjacent inventories. Each one can interact with blocks on all six sides, so to tell it which sides to work with the side must be selected, and a filter installed in the filter slot. A Standard Item Filter set to Blacklist will allow any items to pass through, for instance, but several filters exist to suit most needs. Right Click a filter in the air to configure it. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description84": "Routing Nodes may be used to extend a network, connecting distant locations. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description85": "Finally, any node may be disabled with a Redstone signal, allowing more intelligent routing. For instance, an entire section of a network could be routed through a single Routing Node, allowing that section to be disabled when that node is powered. ",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description86": "Multidisciplinary Sorcerers may prefer not to dirty their hands with a sword. If this sounds like you, the 'Sentient Harm' glyph would make a good addition to your spellbook.",
  "e6e.blood_magic_wip.description87": "Just like the Sentient Sword, the Sentient Harm glyph will drop Will from mobs that are killed with it - just swap the 'Harm' glyph out for it in your attack spells. Just like the normal glyph, things like Amplify will apply when added.",

  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description1": "Note: quests that need tools or tool parts will accept *any* material for the parts, so tinker away!",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description2": "The first step in TiC is to make patterns. These patterns will be required to create the crafting blocks needed to progress. They can also be combined with materials to make the various tool parts. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description3": "The “Materials and You” book provides information on the first tools the tinkerer can make as well as the tier 1 materials available to the tinkerer.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description4": "Tinkers Construct adds some areas to explore, as well as tools to aid the tinkerer in their explorations. These chapters will describe for the tinkerer the gadgets they can create and the areas and materials they can find among the dimensions. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description5": "While stone tools are easy to repair, moving on to metal and higher tiers of parts are required to harvest deeper materials and deal more damage.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description6": "The Puny Smelting guide instructs the tinkerer as to the higher stats and innate abilities of the tier 2 materials, as well as how to construct the melter in order to cast the tier 2 parts.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description7": "Eventually the tinkerer will want to smelt more than 9 ingots worth of metals. They may also wish to create various alloys. Towards that end the knowledge of Mighty Smelting will be required.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description8": "This tome begins to explain the Tier 3 materials the tinkerer can use as well as the various abilities that can be added to tools. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description9": "The final tiered book provides information on the top level machines which can be built using materials from the nether, as well as the tier 4 materials available to the tinkerer for their tools.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description10": "In the overworld, tinkers adds a couple of islands for the tinkerer to find. Sky slime islands can be found floating in the sky. Earth slime islands are found off of coast lines. There are even clay islands which look like slime islands but are plain vanilla islands.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description11": "The nether is a next stop for the tinkerer in terms of finding materials to upgrade their tools. Cobalt ore can be found in the terrain, magma slime islands are found at lava levels and wither skeletons can drop some extra goodies.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description12": "Traveling to the end unlocks additional resources for the tinkerer. From blasting scales off the dragon to finding islands with the most unusual of slimes, there are great ingredients for the tinkerer to find.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description13": "The various crafting blocks from Tinkers form a multiblock structure for accessing them all from a single UI, and the first block to make is a crafting station.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description14": "This block has an advantage over the vanilla crafting table as it’ll hold the materials in the crafting grid and visually show them in world. It will also connect to an adjacent inventory to make crafting easier.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description15": "Before building tools, the tinkerer needs to build the parts that make up those tools. The part builder is the block to do that. With the newer version of TiC comes a streamlined set of parts.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description16": "This is the Tinkers block required for crafting, repairing, and performing simple upgrades on Tinkers tools.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description17": "After crafting the base parts, the tinkerer should select the tool design in the Tinker Station’s UI and assemble the parts into their new tool.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description18": "Tools can also be repaired here with the same material their head parts are made with.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description19": "The Tinkers Chest is a storage block that works with the other tinkers crafting blocks in the multiblock structure. It possesses a larger storage than a single chest and has its own UI tab in the Tinkers combined interface.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description20": "This Tinkers block is a special storage block for parts created with the Part Builder. This is useful when storing stone parts used with sand casts later on in the quest line.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description21": "Before the tinkerer can construct the blocks needed to make and work with tier 2 materials, the tinkerer will need to make grout. This material is a precursor to the building blocks of the more advanced tinkers constructs. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description22": "The Seared Melter is the means by which the tinkerer can melt materials and create higher tiered parts and composite materials. The melter can melt three items at a time and store 9 ingots worth of materials (or 1,296 mb). ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description23": "Note that the melter cannot create alloys of materials; a more powerful Tinkers structure is required for that. Also note that the melter can be powered by a seared fuel tank to get to higher melting points.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description24": "Early on, the materials for more permanent casts are precious and are better saved for that first inventory system. Towards that end, the tinkerer can use the time honored tradition of sand casting.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description25": "Place the sand cast on the casting table, the place the part to be replicated. Remove that part, and the tinkerer is left with a one time use cast. If the tinkerer wants to cast an ingot, they can use an existing one or a brick.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description26": "The tinkers machines allow the tinkerer to apply liquids to materials in order to make new materials. One such material is Lavawood, a fireproof wooden material.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description27": "Other such materials can be found by looking up recipes using the casting table and casting basin in JEI.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description28": "Sand casts are good to get the first tools made, but after a while the use of permanent casts would make the tinkerer’s life a lot more efficient.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description29": "By melting the gold onto a sacrificial part, a permanent cast can be created which can be used more than once.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description30": "Once the Tinkerer creates a few casts, they quickly realize there should be a place to store all of them. The Tinkers Cast Chest is there to provide that place.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description31": "Melting larger amounts of metals and creating alloys requires the use of the multiblock smelter. Even mobs can be melted in the smeltery to produce materials.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description32": "The seared drain allows liquids to be imported and exported while the seared chute allows items to be imported. Combined, these make automating the smeltery a breeze.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description33": "Enter the world of large Tinkers tools. Able to deal much more damage, mine more blocks, cut more grass and fell more trees.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description34": "Once the anvil is placed the tinkerer unlocks full abilities and upgrades requiring 5 input slots, as well as the ability to craft the large tinkers tools.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description35": "This gardening tool is great for cutting large areas of grass as well as large groups of mobs. It can also be used to till the ground for fresh crops.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description36": "When digging tunnels, the sledge hammer is the go to tool, digging out rock in a 3x3 area (expandable to 5x5). Against mobs, this tool possesses Smite II, making it the bane of the undead.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description37": "This weapon deals great damage over a sweeping area, and can have greater reach when attacking mobs.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description38": "This mining tool will break all similar ores within 2 blocks of the tinker’s target, which can be expanded up to a range of 4. Combined with the Sledge Hammer, makes easy work of mining. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description39": "As a weapon, it’s the fastest of the broad weapons, and it’s sharp points give it a Piercing II effect.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description40": "The broad axe is great for felling trees, dropping all logs above the one being broken. The broad axe head also deals a ton of damage, but is quite slow to weild.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description41": "The excavator is made to remove soft materials, shoveling in a 3x3 which can be expanded into a 5x5. As a weapon, it provides the tinkerer with knockback II.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description42": "The dagger is a fast weapon with lower damage than the sword. Its specialty, however, is it can be held in the off hand and used with the right click.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description43": "A tinkerers primary weapon and means of defense. This tool has one fewer upgrade slot in favor of an extra ability slot. It also has a sweeping effect to hit multiple mobs.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description44": "This tool is both useful as a tree feller and as a mob killer. It can be later modified with expanders to increase its area of effect",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description45": "The standard pickaxe and primary Tinkers tool. Can be modified with expanders to increase its mining range. As a weapon, it does lower damage but it gains a bit of piercing to do extra damage to armored mobs.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description46": "The Mattock is the defacto shovel of Tinkers. Right click on the same blocks a shovel can to make paths in world. As a weapon, the extra heft will add knockback to your attacks.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description47": "The Kama is the all-around farmer’s tool, able to till land as well as scythe down grass. Against mobs it is faster than a sword but does a bit less damage.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description48": "Tinker’s repair kits are portable means to repairing the durability of the tinkerer’s tools. The material used to make the kit can repair tools whose head parts are made of the same material.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description49": "This tool provides means for the tinkerer to wrench the various blocks.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description50": "Climbing up to these islands is a task for the tinkerer that is rewarded with sky slime, which is great for crafting items that give extra sky bounding abilities.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description51": "These coastal islands are a great source for green slime and collecting earth slime. This slime has extra springiness for launching the tinkerer far distances.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description52": "These blood and ichor covered islands are a great source for magma crème, and the blood slime is a great resource for helping the tinkerer recover from the harsh mobs of the world.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description53": "These purple islands are home to ender slime, corrupted by the void and possessing some of the spatial attributes that the ender men possess. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description54": "To assist the tinkerer in making gadgets, the tinkerer can craft the Tinkers Gadgetry guide. This Guide helps to the explain the recipes and uses of the various gadgets.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description55": "The go to gadget for tinkerers to travel long distances, don’t forgot to craft a matching pair of boots to ensure the landing can be survived. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description56": "Depending on the slime used, the slings have different properties: Earth slime sends you far, skyslime can be used mid-air, Ichor slings deal great knockback while ender slime teleports you.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description57": "These boots will allow the tinkerer to bounce safely from great heights instead of hitting the ground hard. Unlike the slings, the different boots are purely aesthetic. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description58": "The tinkerer can take the elements of the slimes and make various cakes, each with a different effect: earth slime grants luck, sky slime grants jump boost, blood slime grants regeneration, ichor slime grants fire resistance and ender slime grants levitation.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description59": "These Shuriken provide the tinkerer with some ranged damage options with the flint providing good knockback, while the quartz tends to do more damage.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description60": "Until the tinkerer crafts more suitable tools for moving mobs, the piggybackpack is great for picking up mobs to toss in farms (or the smeltery). Up to 3 can be worn at the same time, albeit with some weight penalties.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description61": "This gadget is great for lighting up far areas and the various nooks and crannies that Mobs like to spawn in.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description62": "The tinkerer has access to various frames where they can put the interesting and unique tools they have created on display! The different frames have different behaviors. Check the gadgetry guide for more information.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description63": "These drops from wither skeletons remember and impart upon the tinkerer’s tools severing when applied as an upgrade. When used as a base part, it applies a necrotic touch. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description64": "These drops, when blasted off the ender dragon, can be combined with the tinkerer’s tools to grant an additional ability slot. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description65": "The boring, old flint and steel lights single blocks on fire, and once it’s used up, it’s gone. Enter the Flint and Bronze.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description66": "This tool has more durability than a typical flint and steel and has the added benefit of accepting abilities and upgrades. Light more than a single tile! Burn parts off of mobs with severing!",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description67": "Most of the tier 3 materials are alloys, combinations of two or more base materials. Alloy blocks are also the gateway to the means to make the large tinkers tools.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description68": "Since the foundry cannot alloy itself, the scorched alloyer can be used to create alloys. Molten metals in ingot tanks around the alloyer combine and can be cast out.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description69": "As regular grout was to the Melter and Smeltery, the tinkerer will find that nether grout is the same to the Foundry and Alloyer.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description70": "Powered by nether materials, the tinkers foundry provides a number of benefits.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description71": "Firstly, the foundry cannot alloy! Now the tinkerer will not have to worry in their automation that they will end up creating unintended materials.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description72": "Secondly, the foundry unlocks material byproducts, meaning chunks of one ore may provide materials of another kind (see JEI recipes involving the foundry controller).",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description73": "Finally, its internal buffer is much larger for the same size compared to the regular smeltery. Combined with the lack of alloying, it allows the tinkerer to store their metals in liquid form.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description74": "Some of the highest tiers of materials and alloys cannot be created without the highest temperature fuels. For those materials, the tinkerer needs blazing blood.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description75": "Made directly from blazes, this high temperature fuel is the top tier of tinkers fuels.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description76": "This pack adds in the Tinkers Planner mod. This mod allows the tinkerer to plan out the materials, upgrades and abilities to be added to the tools to be created.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description77": "To access the planner, click the blueprint icon in the GUI of the Tinker Station or Tinker Anvil.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description78": "Sometimes the tinkerer needs an aesthetic touch to add to the workshop. Other times, the tinkerer is left with less than an ingot of liquid metal in their melter. Enter the Seared Lantern!",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description79": "The Seared lantern can hold up to 100mb of any liquid produced by the Tinkerer and lets that liquid cast a slightly tinted light into the tinkerer’s environment.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description80": "Adding new stats to the tinkerer’s tools requires certain materials applied within the Tinkers Station. Many of these consume upgrade slots.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description81": "To find out what upgrades are available for a given tinkers tool, search JEI for uses of a tool and look for the tab with the hammer and anvil icon.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description82": "In addition to upgrades, Tinkers tools can gain abilities that extend the capabilities of the tools.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description83": "Luck, silk touch, autosmelting, dual-wielding, these are all of the potential abilities available if the tinkerer posseses the right parts.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description84": "Different mods add different forms to the metals that the tinkerer works with, and as such the clever tinkerer would create casts to allow those forms to be made directly with molten metals.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description85": "When you need a hole in the ground quickly, the EFLN is the tool to make. Explosive mining with no destruction of drops.",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description86": "Having all four tiers of materials spread across all four books can seem like a bit of a mess. Luckily, with a bit of ingenuity, the tinkerer can combine all four books into a single volume. Four volumes of information at the tinkerer’s finger tips. ",
  "e6e.tinkers_construct.description87": "Adding a seared or scorched duct to your smeltery or foundry lets you extract specific fluids by applying a bucket or copper can of fluid to the duct as a filter. Right click the duct to access it's UI to insert the filtering item.",
